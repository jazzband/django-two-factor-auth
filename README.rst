Complete Two-Factor Authentication for Django. Built on top of the one-time
password framework django-otp_ and Django's built-in authentication framework
``django.contrib.auth`` for providing the easiest integration into most Django
projects. Inspired by the user experience of Google's Two-Step Authentication,
allowing users to authenticate through call, text messages (SMS), by using a
token generator app like Google Authenticator or a YubiKey_ hardware token
generator (optional).

If you run into problems, please file an issue on GitHub, or contribute to the
project by forking the repository and sending some pull requests. The package
is translated into English, Dutch and other languages. Please contribute your
own language using Transifex_.

Test drive this app through the `example app`_. It demos most features except
the Twilio integration. The example also includes django-user-sessions_ for
providing Django sessions with a foreign key to the user. Although the package
is optional, it improves account security control over
``django.contrib.sessions``.

Compatible with modern Django versions. At the moment of writing that's
including 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, and 4.0 on Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10.
Documentation is available at `readthedocs.org`_.

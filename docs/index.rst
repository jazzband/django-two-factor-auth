Django Two-Factor Authentication Documentation
==============================================

Complete Two-Factor Authentication for Django. Built on top of the one-time
password framework django-otp_ and Django's built-in authentication framework
``django.contrib.auth`` for providing the easiest integration into most Django
projects. Inspired by the user experience of Google's Two-Step Authentication,
allowing users to authenticate through call, text messages (SMS) or by using a
token generator app like Google Authenticator.

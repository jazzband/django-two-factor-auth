Django includes excellent built-in sessions, however all the data is hidden
away into base64 encoded data. This makes it very difficult to run a query on
all active sessions for a particular user. `django-user-sessions` fixes this
and makes session objects a first class citizen like other ORM objects. It is
a drop-in replacement for `django.contrib.sessions`.

I would love to hear your feedback on this package. If you run into
problems, please file an issue on GitHub, or contribute to the project by
forking the repository and sending some pull requests. The package is
translated into English, Dutch and other languages. Please contribute your own
language using Transifex_.

Also, have a look at the online `example app`_, hosted by Heroku_. It also
contains the package `django-two-factor-auth`_, but that application is not a
dependency for this package. Also have a look at the bundled example templates
and views to see how you can integrate the application into your project.

Compatible with Django 2.2 and 3.0 on Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.
Documentation is available at `readthedocs.org`_.


Features
========

To get the list of a user's sessions:

.. code-block:: python

    user.session_set.filter(expire_date__gt=now())

Or logout the user everywhere:

.. code-block:: python

    user.session_set.all().delete()

The user's IP address and user agent are also stored on the session. This
allows to show a list of active sessions to the user in the admin:

And also in a custom layout:

You need to setup GeoIP for the location detection to work. See the Django
documentation on `installing GeoIP`_.


Getting help

Development
===========

How to contribute
-----------------
* Fork the repository on GitHub and start hacking.
* Run the tests.
* Send a pull request with your changes.
* Provide a translation using Transifex_.

Running tests
-------------
This project aims for full code-coverage, this means that your code should be
well-tested. Also test branches for hardened code. You can run the full test
suite with::

    make test

Or run a specific test with::

    make test TARGET=tests.tests.MiddlewareTest

For Python compatibility, tox_ is used. You can run the full test suite with::

  Transifex_. Make sure translators have sufficient time to translate those
  new strings::

    make tx-push

* Add migrations::

    python example/manage.py makemigrations user_sessions
    git commit user_sessions/migrations -m "Added migrations"
